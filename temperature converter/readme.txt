Project Description:
This project is a collaborative effort between Priyanshu, Niraj, and Manan to create a web application for temperature conversion. The application allows users to convert temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius using a simple and intuitive interface.

Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop a web application that utilizes PHP for server-side processing and JavaScript for client-side interactivity. The application should provide users with the ability to input a temperature value and select the input and output temperature units (Fahrenheit or Celsius). Upon triggering the conversion process, the application should display the converted temperature without refreshing the webpage.

Project Components:

Backend (Priyanshu Sharma):
- Developed the server-side PHP script to handle temperature conversion logic.
- Implemented conversion formulas to convert temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
- Communicated with the client-side JavaScript to retrieve input data and return converted temperature values.

Frontend (JavaScript) (Niraj Shrestha):
- Developed client-side JavaScript code to handle user input and trigger temperature conversion.
- Utilized event listeners to detect changes in input temperature value and selected units.
- Calculated converted temperature based on selected units and displayed the result on the webpage without refreshing.

Frontend (HTML/CSS) (Manan Neupane):
- Designed a simple and user-friendly HTML interface for the temperature converter application.
- Implemented CSS styling to improve the visual appearance of the interface, including alignment, spacing, and formatting of input fields, buttons, and result display.

Instructions for Running the Application:
1. Clone the project repository from the GitHub repository link provided.
2. Ensure that you have a compatible web server environment set up (such as Apache or Nginx) with PHP support.
3. Open the project directory in your preferred code editor.
4. Start the web server and navigate to the project directory in your web browser.
5. You should see the temperature converter interface designed by Manan.
6. Enter a temperature value and select the input and output temperature units.
7. Click the conversion button to trigger the conversion process.
